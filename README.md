# Multiple Linear Regression with Python

In this project, I have built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model using Python.
The libraries used are scikit-learn to calculate the regression, pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization.
The data for this project consists of the very popular Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper. 

We will be perfroming the performing tasks:
<ul><li>Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn.
  <li>Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn.
    <li>Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE.
      <li>Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques.
        </ul>
